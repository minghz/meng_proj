# Here are some commands to run =====================
#
# first, we need to run our training
# write training summary to log_dir
# batch size of 10 images
# will run max 5000 steps (10*5000 images)
python cifar10_train.py --log_dir=logs --batch_size=10 --max_steps=5000

# Then, we need to run our evaluation
# checkpoints obtained from the logs dir
# test summary written to eval_dir
# running inference evaluation every 10 seconds
python cifar10_eval.py --eval_interval_secs=10 --checkpoint_dir=logs --eval_dir=eval_logs

# lastly, we need to visualize the evaluation data with tensorboard
# Basically, how accurate are we?
tensorboard --logdir=eval_logs
